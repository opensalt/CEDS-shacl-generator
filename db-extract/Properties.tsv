The metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three metro and six nonmetro groupings, resulting in a nine-part county codification. The codes allow researchers working with county data to break such data into finer residential groups beyond a simple metro-nonmetro dichotomy, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that may be related to degree of rurality and metro proximity.	1 - Counties in metro areas of 1 million population or more 2 - Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population 3 - Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population 4 - Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area 5 - Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area 6 - Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area 7 - Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area 8 - Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area 9 - Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area 	Early Learning -> Program Quality Early Learning -> Staff Quality					000862	60313	ERS Rural-Urban Continuum Code	ERSRuralUrbanContinuumCode	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=21862

There are multiple use cases related to this element, some for longitudinal purposes, some for funding, some for live transactional systems. The descriptions and definitions are intended to meet those needs. Four often misunderstood options are explained below:<BR/>  1.  09999 - Other. Other is intended to indicate that CEDS has not yet defined a circumstance in which this exit occurred.<BR/>  2.  03505 - Exited. Unlike "09999 - Other", the "Exited" option is intended to be used for administrative purposes such as a mid-year grade level change. <BR/>  3.  01931 - Not enrolled, unknown status. This is to be used as a placeholder while additional exit information is collected or to track students who are known to have Discontinued Schooling (dropped out) separate from students whose whereabouts are unknown.<BR/>  4.  03502 - Not enrolled, eligible to return. Different than the 01931 code, the status of this student is not unknown; however, the institution is required to exit the student from membership for an extended period. It is expected the student will reenroll in the same institution following this extended period.	000110	59752		ExitOrWithdrawalType	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=21110

Postsecondary	PS Student	Homeless	No	Homelessness Status	Children and youth who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Homeless children and youth include: 1) children and youth who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; are abandoned in hospitals; or are awaiting foster care placement; 2) children and youth who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or originally used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings; or 3) children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings. 4) migratory children who qualify as homeless because the children are living in circumstances described in the above.

Postsecondary	PS Student	Homeless	No	Status End Date	The last year, month and day when a status applied to an individual.	None			YYYY-MM-DD		This element reflects the end date for a person's status rather than that person's participation in a program. Use Program Participation Exit Date if referring to a person's participation in a program or receipt of services. Status dates and program participation dates don't need to align, they are for different purposes. For example, for a homeless student the Status Begin Date and Status End Date elements are used to record when the student began being homeless to the date when the student ceased being homeless.  The student may begin receiving services under a program for homeless students after becoming homeless and that program may continue to provide services after the student ceases to have the status of "homeless" and therefore have a Program Participation Start Date and Program Participation Exit Date that are different from the status dates.  Students under the McKinney-Vento may continue to receive services until the end of a school year even if they become stably housed at some point during the year.	001228	63668		StatusEndDate	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=22193

Workforce	Quarterly Employment Record		No	Employed After Exit	An individual who is a paid employee or works in his or her own business, profession, or farm, as reported through the State Unemployment Insurance Wage Report, FEDES, or WRIS, after exiting secondary, postsecondary, or adult education or workforce programs.	Yes Unknown 	Persistence and Attainment of Nontraditional Students				Individual-level data obtained by matching records with wage records, FEDES, or WRIS. The State Education Agency defines the time period for this collection around an exit period and a corresponding period for employment and earnings data to be obtained. The option set includes "Yes" for employment found via one of the resources listed in the source element. These sources will provide information about most of the types of jobs that students or former students will  become employed in but not all.  For that reason when a record is "not found" or "not matched" their employment status is "unknown" for the targeted time base.	000988	60457		EmployedAfterExit	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=21990
Workforce	Quarterly Employment Record		No	Military Enlistment After Exit	An individual who is a member of the uniformed armed forces of the United States as reported through FEDES after exiting secondary, postsecondary, or adult education or workforce programs.	Yes No 					Information on military enlistment is collected as a part of the FEDES program which facilitates periodic matches with the Department of Defense Manpower Information Center.  While the unemployment insurance data cannot be used to indicate that an individual is not employed, the DOD Enlistment data can suggest "not enlisted when there is no match."  These data are included in FEDES matches and may need to be "unduplicated" from employment counts.	001412	61292		MilitaryEnlistmentAfterExit	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=22381

Many states report these numbers, some as indications of employment stability.

The sources listed are complementary, rather than alternatives. That is, State UI records only include information for employees within a state's boundaries. The WRIS II system can provide employment data for other states (from their UI wage record systems). State UI records do not include information about federal or postal service employment, nor do they contain information about military enlistments. FEDES provides access to that information. Ideally, an entity will use UI, WRIS (other state UI), and FEDES together.	000994	60463		EmploymentRecordAdministrativeDataSource	https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=21996

Assessments	Assessment Item	Assessment Item APIP Interaction	No	Assessment Item Body Graphic Gap Match Interaction XML	A graphic gap-match interaction is a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. Care should be taken when designing these interactions to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to receive the required gap choices. It must be clear to the candidate which hotspot each choice has been associated with. When associated, choices must appear wholly inside the gaps if at all possible and, where overlaps are required, should not hide each other completely. If the candidate indicates the association by positioning the choice over the gap (e.g., drag and drop) the system should 'snap' it to the nearest position that satisfies these requirements.

The candidate's task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots). The order hotspot interaction should only be used when the spatial relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item.

Like choiceInteraction, the candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of maxChoices. The interaction is initialized from the defaultValue of the associated response variable, a NULL value indicating that no choices are selected (the usual case).
